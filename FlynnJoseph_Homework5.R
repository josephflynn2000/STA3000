#Time difference of 203.4268 days
#the difference between mean death and mean date of stroke

#Question 2
#The probability of getting a female chick is 55%

b1 = dbinom(6, size=10, prob= .55) # b1 = 0.2383
#probability of getting 6 female chicks out of 10

b2 = 1 - pbinom(5, size=10, prob= .55) # b2 = 0.5044
#probability of getting 6 or more female chicks outs of 10

#Question 3

# radndom variable X from a distribution with mean = 80.2 & sd = 2.12
#P(Xâ‰¤a) =0.4, find a and equal it to variable c
c = qnorm(.4, 80.2, 2.12) # c = 79.6629
# X has a proability of .4 of being less than or equal to a = c = 79.6629
